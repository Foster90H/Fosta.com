        <p>Hi, I’m Foster Adu — a passionate Software Developer, systems Administrator, Building Engineer, and Entrepreneur with a mission to influence and empower lives, institutions, and businesses to achieve their goals through innovation and practical solutions.

My educational journey started at Asotwe M/A Junior High School and continued through Bonwire Senior High Technical School, Christ Apostolic University College, IPMC I.T College, and Kumasi Technical University College. Each step built the foundation that fuels my multidisciplinary approach today.

With a strong background in both technology and engineering, I thrive on creating systems that solve real-world problems, whether it's designing software that streamlines operations or overseeing building projects that improve communities. As a business-minded professional, I’m constantly exploring ways to turn ideas into sustainable ventures.

I believe in leading with purpose, integrity, and impact — using my skills not just to build things, but to build people and support visions worth pursuing.

Let’s connect, collaborate, and create meaningful change together.</p>
